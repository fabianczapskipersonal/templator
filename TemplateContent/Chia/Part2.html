<h3>6. Chia Seeds Are High in Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h3>


<p>
    Like flax seeds, chia seeds are very high in Omega-3 fatty acids.
</p><p>
    In fact, chia seeds contain more Omega-3s than salmon, gram for gram.
</p><p>
    However… it’s important to keep in mind that the Omega-3s in them are mostly ALA(Alpha Linolenic Acid), which is not as beneficial as you may think.
</p><p>
    ALA needs to converted into the “active” forms, EPA and DHA, before it can be used by the body.
</p><p>
    Unfortunately, humans are inefficient at converting ALA into the active forms. Therefore, plant Omega-3s tend to be vastly inferior to animal sources like fish.
</p><p>
    Studies have shown that chia seeds (especially if they are milled) can increase blood levels of ALA and EPA, but not DHA… which is a problem.
</p><p>
    Because they don’t supply any DHA (the most important Omega-3 fat), I think chia seeds are overrated as an Omega-3 source.
</p><p>
    In order to get the DHA your body and brain desperately need… either eat fatty fish regularly, take fish oil, or take a DHA supplement if you are vegan or vegetarian.
</p><p>
    Bottom Line: Chia seeds are very high in the Omega-3 fatty acid ALA. However, humans are not good at converting this into DHA, the most important Omega-3 fatty acid.

<h3>7. They Are High in Many Important Bone Nutrients</h3>


<p>
    Chia seeds are high in several nutrients that are important for bone health.
</p><p>
    This includes calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and protein.
</p><p>
    The calcium content is particularly impressive… 18% of the RDA in a single ounce.
</p><p>
    Gram for gram, this is higher than most dairy products.
</p><p>
    Chia seeds may be considered an excellent source of calcium for people who don’t eat dairy.
</p><p>
    Bottom Line: Chia seeds are high in calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and protein. All of these nutrients are essential for bone health.
</p><p>


    <h3> 8. Chia Seeds Can Cause Major Improvements in Type 2 Diabetics</h3>


<p>
    The most successful application of chia seeds to date was in a study on type 2 diabetic patients
</p><p>
    In this study, 20 diabetic patients received either 37 grams of chia seeds, or 37 grams of wheat bran, for 12 weeks .
</p><p>
    When they got the chia seeds, they saw improvements in several important health markers.
</p><p>
    Blood pressure went down by 3-6 mm/Hg and an inflammatory marker called hs-CRPwent down by 40%. A risk factor called vWF also decreased by 21%.
</p><p>
    There was also a small drop in blood sugar, but it wasn’t statistically significant.
</p><p>
    Given that chia seeds are high in fiber, it does seem plausible that they could help reduce blood sugar spikes after meals, but this needs to be confirmed in studies.
</p><p>
    Bottom Line: A study in type 2 diabetics showed that chia seeds can significantly lower blood pressure and a marker for inflammation.
</p><p>


    9. Chia Seeds Can Improve Exercise Performance as Much as a Sports Drink



    Legend has it that the Aztecs and Mayans used chia seeds to fuel performance back in the day.
</p><p>
    There is one recent study suggesting that this may be effective…
</p><p>
    In this study, 6 participants “carb loaded” with either gatorade, or a mix of half gatorade/half chia seeds.
</p><p>
    Then they ran for an hour on a treadmill, followed by a timed 10 kilometer long run.
</p><p>
    There was no difference between the two groups.
</p><p>
    In other words, replacing half of the gatorade with chia seeds did not reduce the performance of the athletes, indicating that chia seeds were of some use.
</p><p>
    According to this study, chia seeds can help athletes “carb load” for endurance events, while increasing their intake of nutrients and decreasing their intake of sugar.
</p><p>
    However, I’d personally like to see some larger studies on this. Given that most of the carbs in chia seeds are fiber, it doesn’t make much sense that they could be used for carb loading.
</p><p>
    Bottom Line: One small study shows that chia seeds can partly replace gatorade as a way of carb loading for endurance athletes, but this needs to be studied more.
</p><p>


    <h3> 10. Chia Seeds Are Easy to Incorporate Into Your Diet</h3>


<p>
    Okay, this last one is not a health benefit, but important nonetheless.
</p><p>
    Chia seeds are incredibly easy to incorporate into your diet.
</p><p>
    The seeds themselves taste rather bland, so you can add them to pretty much anything.
</p><p>
    They also don’t need to be ground like flax seeds, which makes them much easier to prepare.
</p><p>
    They can be eaten raw, soaked in juice, added to porridges and puddings, or added to baked goods.
</p><p>
    You can also sprinkle them on top of cereal, yogurt, vegetables or rice dishes.
</p><p>
    Because of their ability to absorb both water and fat, they can be used to thicken sauces and even used as egg substitutes in recipes.
</p><p>
    They can also be mixed with water and turned into a gel.
</p><p>
    Adding chia seeds to recipes will dramatically boost the nutritional value.
</p><p>
    If you want to buy chia seeds, then there is an excellent selection on Amazon with thousands of customer reviews.
</p><p>
    They do seem to be well tolerated… but if you’re not used to eating a lot of fiber, then there is a possibility of digestive side effects if you eat too much of them at a time.
</p><p>
    A common dosage recommendation is 20 grams (about 1.5 tablespoons) of chia seeds, twice per day.
</p><p>
