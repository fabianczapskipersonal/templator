<h3>Here is how this scientist described vitamin B17:</h3>

<p>"The best way to understand the effect of vitamin B15 is to think of it as instant oxygen. It increases the oxygen efficiency of the entire body and aids in the detoxification of waste products".</p>

<p>As we know, lack of proper oxygen supply to the cells is a major cause of long-term illness. Therefore, taking apricot kernels may possibly correct this issue, at least to a certain degree. So by re-oxygenating our systems, the kernels will help detoxify them as well.</p>

<p>Since apricot kernels are rich in oils, they may help support the brain function and the work of the central nervous system. Healthy oils also strengthen the muscles and may therefore boost the function of the cardiovascular system.</p>

<p>Apricot kernels are a staple food widely sold in Asian bazaars. Asian cultures have traditionally used apricot kernels in cooking, and as a snack in its own right or combined with other nuts and seeds.</p>

<p>A very fascinating example here is that of Hunza people who live in Pakistanian Himalayas. They are known to consume large amounts of apricot kernels as part of their diet and have high longevity rates, as compared to the rest of human populations.</p>
