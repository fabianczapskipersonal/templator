<h3>Apricot kernels offer a number of health-boosting properties.</h3>

<p>They offer a powerful combination of some chemical compounds highly valuable for human health.</p>

<h3>Apricot Kernels Nutritional Profile:</h3>
<p>Apricot kernels are rich in oils (45-50%), proteins (23-26%), and carbohydrates (8%); they also contain dietary fibre (5%) and ash (4%).</p>

<p>The oil content of apricot kernels comprises mostly of monounsaturated (ex., oleic acid) and polyunsaturated (ex., linoleic acid) fatty acids, but includes some saturated fats as well.</p>

<p>One study gives the following breakdown of fatty acids in apricot kernels:</p>

<p>Oleic acid (C18:1) ~ 74.59%;</p>

<p>Linoleic acid (C18:2) ~ 19.57%;</p>

<p>Stearic acid (C18:0) ~ 0.96%;</p>

<p>Palmitic acid (C16:0) ~ 4.11%;</p>

<p>Palmitoleic acid (C16:1) ~ 0.59%;</p>

<p>Arachidonic acid (C20:4) ~ 0.18%.</p>

<p>Apricot kernels are reported to have a high content of phenolic compounds as well. A study on 14 apricot genotypes in India revealed that their total phenolic content ranged from 92mg to 162mg of gallic acid equivalent per 100g apricot kernels.</p>

<p>Phenols are powerful anti-oxidants that fight free radicals in our systems. By neutralizing free radicals and reducing oxidative stress in the body, phenols may be useful for the treatment of various conditions such as: cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Apricot kernel oil has a significant presence of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), which is another potent fat-soluble anti-oxidant.</p>

<p>Apricot kernels are also rich in a rare chemical called amygdalin, or vitamin B17.</p>

<p>Amygdalin was discovered as a compound in apricot kernels by Dr. Krebs in the early 1950s. In natural nutrition circles, amygdalin is widely thought to help with cancer treatment and prevention.</p>

<p>There are basically two types of apricot kernels - bitter and sweet. Bitter apricot kernels contain the highest concentration of vitamin B17 and should be taken instead of sweet ones if you plan to consume apricot kernels specifically for this nutrient.</p>

<p>Another interesting compound that was also found in apricot kernels by Dr. Krebs is pangamic acid, or vitamin B15.</p>
